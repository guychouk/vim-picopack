1. INTRODUCTION                                     *picopack-introduction*

Picopack is a minimal wrapper around Vim's native |packages| system. It adds
four commands for installing, updating, and cleaning packages — nothing else.

Vim 8 introduced built-in package loading from the `pack/` directory, but
shipped no mechanism to actually install or manage packages. Picopack fills
that gap with the smallest possible footprint.

2. CONFIGURATION                                    *picopack-configuration*

                                                    *g:picopack*
Define your packages in a list. Entries can be GitHub shorthand (`user/repo`)
or full URLs:
>
        let g:picopack = [
          \ 'tpope/vim-fugitive',
          \ 'junegunn/fzf.vim',
          \ 'https://gitlab.com/user/plugin.git',
        \ ]
<
This variable must be set before the commands are used, typically in your
|vimrc|.

                                                    *g:picopack_opt*
Optional packages are defined the same way but loaded on demand with
|:packadd| rather than automatically at startup:
>
        let g:picopack_opt = [
          \ 'yegappan/lsp',
        \ ]
<
These are cloned to `pack/bundle/opt` instead of `pack/bundle/start`.
See |packages| for how optional package loading works.

                                                    *g:picopack_path*
The directory where start packages are cloned. Defaults to the first entry
in 'packpath' under `pack/bundle/start`:
>
        let g:picopack_path = '~/.vim/pack/bundle/start'
<
The opt path is derived automatically by replacing `start` with `opt`.
Packages in start are loaded automatically by Vim on startup; packages in
opt are loaded only when requested via |:packadd|.

3. COMMANDS                                         *picopack-commands*

                                                    *:PicopackInstall*
:PicopackInstall        Clone any packages from |g:picopack| and
                        |g:picopack_opt| that are not already present.
                        Uses `git clone --depth=1` for shallow clones.

                                                    *:PicopackUpdate*
:PicopackUpdate         Run `git pull --rebase` in each installed package
                        directory (both start and opt).

                                                    *:PicopackClean*
:PicopackClean          Remove any directories under the start and opt
                        paths that do not correspond to an entry in
                        |g:picopack| or |g:picopack_opt| respectively.

                                                    *:PicopackUpgrade*
:PicopackUpgrade        Update picopack itself by running `git pull --rebase`
                        in its own directory.
